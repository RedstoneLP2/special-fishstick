Yes, the name is randomly generated by github.

## how to build

- Run `make` in project root

## What works?

- Moving stuff around in memory and looking into the cpu registers
- loading (binary) files into the address space

## TODO

- opcode parsing
- implementing the majority of the instructions
- Better output
- Input
- QOL Stuff
